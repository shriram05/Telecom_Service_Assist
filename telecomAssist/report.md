Dear Suresh Patel,

Thank you for reaching out about your recent bill. I understand that seeing a higher bill can be concerning. 

After reviewing your account and usage details, I found that your total bill for the last billing cycle was $1999, which is in line with your current **Business Essential** plan. During this period, you used 8.3 GB of data, along with 1500 voice minutes and 200 SMS messages. While you are under the data limit of your plan, the voice minutes used seem to be significantly high, and there are no additional charges reflected for this month.

To optimize your costs and services, I recommend switching to our **Premium Unlimited** plan, which is available for $1299 per month. This plan provides unlimited data, voice minutes, and SMS, ensuring you won't have to worry about exceeding any limits in the future. By switching, you would save $700 each month. 

If you're interested in making this change or have any other questions, please let me know how I can assist you further. 

Thank you for being a valued customer!

Best regards,

[Your Name]
