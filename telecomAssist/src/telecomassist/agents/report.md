Dear SivaPrasad Valluru,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your recent bill inquiry. I understand that you have noticed a higher bill amount for May 2023. After thoroughly reviewing your account and usage patterns, I would like to provide you with a detailed explanation of your charges.

For the billing period of May 2023, your total bill amounts to $799.00, which corresponds to your current service plan, the Standard Plan. Here are the key points regarding your bill:

- **Service Plan**: You are subscribed to the Standard Plan, which charges $799 monthly. This plan includes:
  - 5 GB of data
  - Unlimited voice minutes
  - Unlimited SMS messages

- **Usage Details**: 
  - You utilized 4.5 GB of data, which is within the plan limits.
  - Your usage for voice minutes was 450, which is also covered under the unlimited feature of your plan.
  - For SMS messages, you sent 230, again within the unlimited limits.

- **Additional Charges**: There were no additional charges incurred on your account during this billing cycle. All usage was well within the allowances of your Standard Plan.

- **Comparison with Past Bills**: Unfortunately, data from previous billing cycles was not available for comparison, but itâ€™s important to note that your current usage fits well within the allocated benefits of your plan.

Given that your usage aligns perfectly with your Standard Plan, it is my recommendation that you continue with this plan. It effectively meets your needs without any extra costs. Alternatives do not offer better value for your current usage, as they might either have lower limits or higher costs without the same benefits.

If you have further questions or require assistance with anything else, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for being a valued customer.

Best regards,
